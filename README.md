Building Machine Learning Systems

Mission

My Aim: The main aim is to learn how to design, guild and evaluate end to end systems, helping 
understand AI engineering rather than rushing to build AI systems.


What's In the repo

This repository is a learning stack for AI systems engineering.
It includes baytorch: all the code am using to understand the inner workings of pytorch and AI systems
