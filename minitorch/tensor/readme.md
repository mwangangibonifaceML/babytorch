Tensor

Overview:

The tensor class is the fundamental data structure in machine learning. Every NN operates on these tensors. In this moduel, i'll build N-dimensional tensors from scratch, gaining deep insight into how pytorch works and powers most AI systems.

By the end, the tensor created will support most arithmetic operations, broadcasting and shape manipulation.

Learning Objectives:

- **Implement** a complete Tensor colass with arithmetic, matrix multiplication, shape manipulations and reductions
- **Master** broadcasting sementics that enable efficient computation without data copying
- **Understand** computational complexity and memory trade-offs

What am not building yet:
- Automatic Differentiation: Done later
- GPU support (numpy runs on cpu only)
